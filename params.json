  "body": "### What is TwitTalk.\r\nTwitTalk is a very simplistic use of the Twitter API. It encompasses both the search and user profile API to grab both text and media tweets. Right now, it will take the last x amount of tweets from users where the language is determined to be english(en) who have mentioned Kate Spade/Jack Spade or the tweets that are from Kate Spade and Company entities. The layout is built with JQUERY ([Freewall.js](http://vnjs.net/www/project/freewall/)). The twitter process is built with PHP and the rest is just vanilla JS.\r\n\r\n### DEMO\r\nhttps://www.raymondborkowski.com/twit/twit.php\r\n\r\n### THINGS TO COME\r\n* Add time to switch div to next tweet function\r\n* Add callback to call ajax call after looped through all tweets (4 mins?)\r\n* Add Page loader .gif until page has successfully loaded\r\n* Filter expletive words\r\n* Add twitter videos to auto play\r\n*>>  With this, make video div last the full length of the video or if gif 2x video length\r\n* Add Instagram API\r\n* Add newest #MissAdventure Video from YouTube with API\r\n* SPEED UP\r\n\r\n### How to get this to work for you\r\nAs I stated above, this is a very simple Twitter API use. To get this to work for you, you will just need to enter your access tokens in php/twit.php and change the query strings to whatever you want to search! After that, throw it up on your localhost and it should work fresh out of the box!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis was made by @raymondborkowski If you have any questions/concerns/comments, please go ahead and let me know!
