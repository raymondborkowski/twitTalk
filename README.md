  ###What is TwitTalk.
  TwitTalk is a very simplistic use of the Twitter API. It encompasses both the search and user profile API to grab both text and media tweets. Right now, it will take the last x amount of tweets from users where the language is determined to be english(en) who have mentioned Kate Spade/Jack Spade or the tweets that are from Kate Spade and Company entities. The layout is built with JQUERY ([Freewall.js](http://vnjs.net/www/project/freewall/)). The twitter process is built with PHP and the rest is just vanilla JS.

 ###How to get this to work for you
 As I stated above, this is a very simple Twitter API use. To get this to work for you, you will just need to enter your access tokens in php/twit.php and change the query strings to whatever you want to search! After that, throw it up on your localhost and it should work fresh out of the box!
